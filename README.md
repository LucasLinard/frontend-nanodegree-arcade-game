#Arcade Clone Project

## Requirements
A web browser capable of running Javascript. No other libraries are needed.

## How To Run
Simply download the files from the github and run the index.html file on you favorite web browser.

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the little guy across the street.
Avoid the bugs. If you reach the river, you will be `teleported` to te sidewalk again and a new bug appears.
Each move you make earns you some score points. Try to get as many points as you can.

The game ends when you hit a bug. To start a new game, simply use the arrow keys again to move your character.

Hope you'll enjoy.
